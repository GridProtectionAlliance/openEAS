Extended Analytic Services (EAS) for [openXDA](https://github.com/GridProtectionAlliance/openXDA) 

openEAS is a Visual Studio development template for a Windows Service that embeds an externally developed DLL
(such as one from MatLab) within a platform that can obtain input data from openXDA and store analytic results
to openXDA for display in other tools -- such as EPRI Open PQ Dashboard. See the [openEAS Installation Guide](https://github.com/GridProtectionAlliance/openEAS/wiki) for details.
